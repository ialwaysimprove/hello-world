# hello-world
I am just learning GitHub. I am just improving :D
I am just another normal human being. I am not special, I am not smart and most definitely I am not talented; These things aren't birth rights, these things are deserved! And yes they are changeable and upgradable through effort. I know that such change is hard, it's difficult, yet possible and good things never happen easily, you don't just sit on a chair and get your work done by itself, you actually plan and work hard and work consistently for the things you love and for the things you love to achieve.
